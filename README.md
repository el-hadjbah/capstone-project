# Purpose/Problem Statement
My program is meant to help poeple manage their passwords. It also lets the user edit it, like to sort the passwords in alphabetical or reverse. It adresses the problem of people forgetting their passwords.
# Target Audience
This is for people who have passwords, so anyone can use it to securely store their passwords
# Solution + Limitations
The project stores passwords. It can also sort the passwords and reverse them. I wish I could have added the ability for users to add passwords and to randomize the letter in existing passwords to make new ones.
# Key Features / Key Components
The user can view their passwords, sort them alphabetically and reverse them
# Technical Challenges + Future Plans
It was hard to figure out how to be able to consistently show the list of passwords after every input from the user. As I said before, I wish I could add the ability to add passwords to the list, but I ran out of time. I also wish I could attach the passswords to usernames.
# Project Timeline
Briefly explain how you broke this project up across days, weeks, or months.
I broke this project up into a couple days as the deadline was soon and I had not started. I started with an idea for a simple password manager, then added the features along the way.
